# Initial Approach for Incremental Development (Sprints 2â€“6)

This document outlines our strategy to incrementally build the Big Bucks application. Our approach leverages a sprint-based methodology with clearly defined tasks and responsibilities for our 5-member team.

## Overall Strategy

1. **Sprint Review & Planning**  
   - At the beginning of each sprint, we hold a review meeting to evaluate completed tasks and determine which features, improvements, or bug fixes to implement next.

2. **Issue Creation & Prioritization**  
   - We break down the planned increments into discrete issues. Each issue includes:
     - Clear acceptance criteria
     - Estimated effort
     - Dependencies (if any)
   - Issues are prioritized based on impact and dependencies.

3. **Task Distribution**  
   - Tasks are distributed among five team members with specialized responsibilities:
     - **Member 1 (UI/Frontend Developer):** Focus on user interface, templates, and client-side logic.
     - **Member 2 (Backend Developer):** Work on API endpoints, business logic, and integration with external services.
     - **Member 3 (Database & Integration Specialist):** Manage schema updates, database queries, and data integration tasks.
     - **Member 4 (QA/Testing Engineer):** Develop and execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
     - **Member 5 (DevOps & Documentation Lead):** Oversee CI/CD pipelines, Docker containerization, deployment, and maintain project documentation and architectural diagrams.

4. **Incremental Development & Integration**  
   - Each sprint focuses on a subset of features.
   - Code is developed, tested, and integrated continuously.
   - Project artifacts (class diagrams, database designs, API docs) are updated at the end of every sprint.

5. **Continuous Feedback & Reporting**  
   - At the end of each sprint, we meet with our teaching assistant for a sprint review.
   - Feedback is used to adjust our plan and refine our implementation.
   - A detailed sprint status report is submitted after each sprint.

This structured and iterative approach helps ensure quality, risk management, and continuous improvement throughout our development process.
